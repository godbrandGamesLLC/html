<h2>Right and bottom attributes function like baselines, because 'right:0' is all the way to right or to the bottom respectively.
<h2>so to go left or up, just enter an integer </h2>

<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>

<div class="fixed">
This div element has position: fixed;
